    <h1>Why is Color 3-Dimensional?</h1>
    <h3>Thomas Porter, July 22, 2021</h3>
    <p>Because humans have three kinds of cones: light receptive cells in our retina that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light. We have cones that correspond to red (long wavelength), green (medium wavelength), and blue (short wavelength), which are the three dimensions of human color vision.</p>
    <p>Next question: why do we have three kinds of cones? Why not two? Five? 16? There may be no good answer to this, as many species have different numbers. But I will offer mhy speculation.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Observation 1: the space of wavelengths of light is 1-dimensional. It's represented by a single number, and the gamut can be seen across a rainbow.</li>
        <li>Observation 2: Sunlight contains a relatively even spread of wavelengths. </li>
        <li>Observation 3: It seems like a lot of what we see has either extra intensity or extra deficiency in one specific wavelength. This is the most arguable observation, and is quite a generalization, but I think it leads to an interesting conclusion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The conclusion is that most light profiles we see look something like this:</p>
