<p>I was thinking about causality and its representation as a directed, acyclic graph when I realized how often we think of causality as cyclic. Feedback loops, and interaction in general, are well described as cycles of causal relations. So how does this interact with the general notion of acyclic causality?</p>

<p>The answer is not very profound, but I do find it neat enough to talk about. In a diagram of a positive feedback loop, for example between the distance between two objects and the gravitational force between those objects, the points in the diagram are not events, but systems, or objects. We understand feedback loops as resulting from acyclic, causal relationships between individual events, but the events exist on a persistent, orderly trajectory through spacetime. When these events are persistent and orderly enough, we think of them as objects or systems. Then, when we aggregate the constituent events of a system into one object, we are identifying various events that occur at different times. This collapses a series of causal relationships into a single causal relationship, which may indeed form part of a cycle. </p>

<p>The best way for me to think of these is as "causal helices." When we 'mod' a helix by the lateral plane, it is mapped to a line. When we mod it by the dimension of its central axis, it indeed is mapped to a circle. The familiar notion of a helix is perfect for this idea that acyclic patterns are mapped onto cycles without contradiction. </p>

<p>This is an elaboration of the familiar situation of interacting systems. Usually the behavior of these systems is governed by differential equations, seen as the continuum limit of these causal helices, when such a limit exists. But when dealing with cyclic causality in the form of these modded causal helices, the resulting differential equations always have solutions for any initial configuration, since the interdependent equations (reflecting pseudo-cyclic causality) are actually emergent from independent dynamics (reflecting helical, thus acyclic, causality). So we are used to our dynamics of interaction being able to evolve from any starting state, despite the formally cyclic causality.  </p>

<p>This brings us to bona fide causal (or 'closed, timelike') loops. Their possibility is debated, and the controversy, as I see it, boils down to the fact that they can be mathematically consistent (namely, under the requirement that they be mathematically consistent), but they are not consistent with our assumption of "any possible starting state" from above. This is because an integral equation is added to the differential equation, and may not have so general a solution. In other words, on one hand there are physicists who are happy with cyclic causality, as long as at each point in the cycle, the laws of physics are obeyed. Essentially, if you were to be inside the loop, and you evolved according to the laws of physics, then as long as those laws put you exactly back in your initial configuration by the time you got back to the "beginning" of the loop, you have successfully avoided all paradoxes and there's no reason to outlaw that system as physically impossible. The problem is that <em>if</em> we were to magically inject a state into that loop, without the property of returning to its starting state (i.e. the laws of physics are incompatible with a causal loop with that state in it), then we would have a paradox. The other camp is not happy with this inability of a system to accommodate any state, and with the non-locality that would seem to be necessary to "enforce" an integral equation.</p>

<p>I am not very familiar with the debate on this issue (of which there has surely been plenty), so please consider this post is a mere initial foray. I do not know what I think about genuine cyclic causality, but I have yet to be convinced that this magic <em>if</em> of state injection gives any trouble to the possibility of closed, timelike curves.</p>

<p>An interesting addendum: the magic <em>if</em> would qualify, to a philosopher, as a counterfactual. In what I think is actually a strange coincidence, philosophers and lawyers use counterfactuals to <em>define</em> causality in the first place! Such a construction requires modality, possible worlds, and generally 'escaping the system' in a way that does not convince my physicist aspect, and I think a similar failure occurs when trying to use it to rule out closed timelike curves. It seems that to use such an argument would be to say "such and such causal structure would <em>cause</em> a contradiction" (where the first notion of causality is physical, the second epistemic or modal). My basic reaction to this is to reject a multilayered causality, and instead credit the first layer, of physical causality, as having the final say.</p>
