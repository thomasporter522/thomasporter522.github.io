What is part of the grammar and what is a result of general reasoning? Pragmatics is often thought of as the study of how meaning depends on the context of utterance.

In this course, we will investigate various topics that walk this line, including varieties of linguistic inference (including entailment, presupposition, and implicature), anaphora, indexicals, and speech acts.</p></div><li class="collapsible">Ling 4403: Syntax I</li><div class="description" class="content" style="display:none;"><p>An advanced introduction to syntactic theory within the principles and parameters/minimalist frameworks.
