            <h3>Computer Science</h3> <ul> <li class="collapsible">CS 6802: Lattices</li><div class="content" style="display:none;"><p>A mathematically rigorous course on lattices. Lattices are periodic sets of vectors in high-dimensional space. They play a central role in modern cryptography, and they arise naturally in the study of high-dimensional geometry (e.g., sphere packings). We will study lattices as both geometric and computational objects. Topics include Minkowski's celebrated theorem, the famous LLL algorithm for finding relatively short lattice vectors, Fourier-analytic methods, basic cryptographic constructions, and modern algorithms for finding shortest lattice vectors. We may also see connections to algebraic number theory.</p></div><li class="collapsible">CS 6764: Reasoning about Knowledge</li><div class="content" style="display:none;"><p>Knowledge plays a crucial role in distributed systems, game theory, and artificial intelligence.

                <li class="collapsible">Ling 4425: Pragmatics</li><div class="content" style="display:none;"><p>What is the relationship between what words mean and how they are used? What is part of the grammar and what is a result of general reasoning? Pragmatics is often thought of as the study of how meaning depends on the context of utterance. However, it can be difficult to draw a line between pragmatics and semantics. In this course, we will investigate various topics that walk this line, including varieties of linguistic inference (including entailment, presupposition, and implicature), anaphora, indexicals, and speech acts.</p></div><li class="collapsible">Ling 4403: Syntax I</li><div class="content" style="display:none;"><p>An advanced introduction to syntactic theory within the principles and parameters/minimalist frameworks.

The course aims to give students to the ability to address questions regarding syntactic and semantic properties of languages in a rigorous and informed fashion. Topics covered include phrase structure, grammatical relations, transformations, semantic composition, modification, quantification, and the syntax/semantics interface.
